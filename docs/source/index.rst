Canon Printer Not Connecting to WiFi: Why and How to Fix It
------------------------------------------------------------

In today’s world, wireless printing is a convenient way to manage home and office tasks. Canon printers are popular for their reliable performance, but sometimes users face an issue where the Canon printer won’t connect to WiFi. This problem can be frustrating but is usually easy to fix with a few careful steps. In this article, we’ll explain the possible reasons behind this issue and provide simple solutions.

Common Reasons Why Canon Printer Won’t Connect to WiFi
-------------------------------------------------------

1️⃣ **Weak WiFi Signal**  
If your printer is placed too far from the WiFi router or there are thick walls or obstacles between them, the signal may be weak or unstable, causing connection failure.

2️⃣ **Incorrect WiFi Password**  
Entering the wrong network password while setting up the printer can prevent it from connecting to the WiFi.

3️⃣ **Network Compatibility Issues**  
Canon printers typically support 2.4 GHz networks. If your router is set to 5 GHz only, the printer might not connect.

4️⃣ **Outdated Printer Firmware or Driver**  
An outdated printer driver or firmware may lead to connection issues with modern WiFi networks.

5️⃣ **Router Issues**  
Technical problems with the router, such as network congestion, limited DHCP settings, or temporary glitches, can block your printer from connecting.

6️⃣ **Firewall or Security Software Interference**  
Some firewalls or antivirus software might block printer connections, especially on shared or office networks.
